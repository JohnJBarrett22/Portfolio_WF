          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-2">I have had the opportunity to supervise John at Toys R Us. During his tenure, he was able to maximize the performance and results of the store and the team consistently. Through his communication and execution standards, he could motivate the entire team to achieve goals and efficiencies which led to higher sales and profit levels month after month. This led to a successful year not only in the store, but helped the entire district financially. In addition, the store team admired and respected his leadership ability. John is truly a pleasure to work with.</span><br><strong class="bold-text">-Tony O&#x27;Berry</strong><br></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-5">I had the pleasure of working with John at a national retail startup as colleagues in the capacity of a multi unit district manager. John&#x27;s attention to detail and drive for results helped push his team to excellence. his focus on the goals and initiatives were inspiring, and his personable and approachable leadership style allowed him to engage with his employees and produce heavily engaged and dedicated employees.<br><br>Working as part of a team of 3 across the nation, John was crucial in helping develop strategies, initiatives, competencies, and solutions for an ever growing business.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-2">-Geoff Carlson</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-4">John was a great advocate for my professional goals both in and outside of the company. His communication was always clear and insightful even if there was bad news. He was the kind of manager I always wanted.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-3">-Richard Stahlmann</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-6">John has proven himself to be not only a capable, but personable leader as the West Coast DM for Marbles.<br><br>Rather than issue edicts from on high, he makes the extra effort to reach out either through regular phone chats to on site visits. When in store he is not simply an idle bystander, he is interacting with customers, ringing sales and taking a truly hands on approach not seen by many in his level of management.<br><br>Furthermore, he challenges his staff to do more than simply make the business function. He challenges us to be leaders, not just managers. He accomplishes this by tasking us with captainships - that all the West Coast is working as a united team and not mere disparate entities.<br><br>He has proven himself to be a spirited leader amongst the DM team of Marbles and has become an invaluable asset to the West Coast.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-7">-Frank Youngman</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-8">I have had the pleasure of working for John at three different companies now, and I grow profoundly more and more impressed with his management and leadership skills each time. I would not consider blindly venturing into another job for anyone, except for John. I believe this man will conquer the world and it is an honor to be standing in his shadow. Working for John, I know that I will be working with a man of integrity, fairness and kindness who is not only an inspiration, but who is willing to give you 110%. John is an excellent leader and his expectations for his employees are high, but he pushes you to reach your fullest potential. He sees in you what you have not yet seen in yourself and he brings out the best in you. It is a privilege to call him boss-man!</span><br><strong class="bold-text-9">-Jessica Johnson, CFMG</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-10">Basketball Coach Red Auerbach once said, “you can’t teach height.” John has many important qualities that cannot be taught, including diligence, perseverance, and a positive attitude. He faces a mountain of paperwork, e-mails, requests, and issues daily, but he&#x27;s able to roll up his sleeves, dive in, and still be cheerful around the office. Turning around and growing our Adopt &amp; Shop operations is a huge challenge and I think John&#x27;s one of the few people up to the task.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-11">-Courtney Treweek</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_left"><span class="text-span-11">I have had the pleasure of working with John for more than a year now. John impressed me on day one and continues to do so every day with his commitment to his team. John is responsible for retail operations at Found Animals Foundation. When John started with the organization there was one retail store that had very little structure. John has not only transformed the existing store, he has since successfully opened a second store and is in the process of opening the flagship store. John has set his sights on operational excellence and is well on his path to achieving this goal. He has done this by setting clear direction and providing excellent leadership to the largest department in the organization.<br><br>John has been asked to wear a variety of hats since he joined Found Animals including being the district manager, scouting for desirable real estate for store expansion, navigating city zoning and building code requirements, being a public figure for the organization and all things operational – finance, IT, HR, etc. John has faced each of these challenges with a positive attitude and a steady hand. John is an asset to any organization.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-12">-Jennifer Wordham</strong></p>

        <div class="_2_block">
          <p class="testimonial_para_right"><span class="text-span">Superpower: Maker of leaders.<br><br>John excels at growing others. During our weekly conference calls, instead of talking AT everyone, he would assign different areas of the business for each store manager to cover. This gave us a sense of ownership and a chance to improve our skills at presenting.<br><br>During my first month of employment I suggested to John that the merchandising was not the greatest. Instead of John providing his own solution, he asked me, what would I do to make it better. At the time I was just a manager-in-training and John was two levels above me at the district level. For a district manager to ask my opinion made me feel extremely valued and therefore encouraged me to contribute even more.<br><br>John is the type of leader that others WANT to follow. He genuinely cares about his team and is amazingly brilliant at bringing out the best in others. His results with increasing sales and other performance indicators all show that he will get the job done in a fantastic manner. John is a force-multiplier and I guarantee that any company he joins will accomplish great things.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-4">-Scott Lebar</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_right">To all concerned parties, John is a Manager who has always took the time and went the extra mile for his customers as well as his employees, his leadership skills are beyond standard. John is a Manager that can assist with taking any company to the next level.<br><strong class="bold-text-5">-Rodney Peete</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_right"><span class="text-span-3">I met and worked for John Barrett in the first quarter of 2014 when he was hired to manage the west coast district for Marbles The Brain Store. Mr. Barrett’s success is obvious from his resume. What is not obvious is his incredible sense of respect toward others and his skill with written and verbal communication.<br><br>Mr. Barrett’s respect toward others is demonstrated when he listens more than he speaks, by the nature of his feedback, by his accessibility, and by his demeanor. He is fair and gracious in his feedback of others, is open to criticism, and is motivating and demanding of others without being aggressive or pushy. I would describe Mr. Barrett as a genuine and authentic people-person who is constantly motivating others to reach their highest potential.<br><br>John Barrett is a highly effective written and verbal communicator who is relentless in providing clear goals and objectives. John sends a daily email report to all the stores in his district. The report summarizes the previous day’s sales numbers for his entire district. He acknowledges the successful stores and store employees and verbally gives them a pat on the back. In the report he provides strategies and encourages stores that are under-performing to improve their sales. In addition he calls the stores to give encouragement, direction, and to motivate the staff. This includes personally calling stores on Sundays and holidays.<br><br>It was a pleasure to work for Mr. John Barrett. He is an admired and respected manager.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-6">-Laura Artman</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_right"><span class="text-span-7">Working with John was one of the highlights of my tenure with Marbles. John&#x27;s ability to provide support to increase, not only productivity, but a sense of teamwork - that we are all striving for the same goal - really improved morale in many, if not all, the West Coast stores.<br><br>John managed to increase manager&#x27;s responsibilities by relying on their strengths and utilizing them to improve the entire division, a piece of information that I carry with me to this day.<br><br>John always managed to bring out the best in his staff, while encouraging us to reach for that brass ring. I would work with John again in a heartbeat, if he needed me to. He brings his great experience and knowledge to his position and does it masterfully.</span><br><strong class="bold-text-8">-Steven Vargas</strong></p>
          <p class="testimonial_para_right"><span class="text-span-9">John is a driven individual with the ability to motivate people, achieve goals, and cultivate team-mindedness. He sets clear objectives and standards and expects complete compliance while at the same time exuding a friendly and personable demeanor. This is a skill I have seen rarely in my superiors, and one that I admire greatly about John.<br><br>Perhaps John&#x27;s greatest impression on me while I worked under him was his steadfast positive &quot;can-do&quot; attitude. No matter the weight of challenge in front of him, he approached it with resolve, excitement, and a smile to top it off. Nothing phases him - he just keeps pursuing the target, and expects everyone working for him to join him on the mission.<br><br>John is an incredible boss and colleague - one that you want on your team. He delegates responsibility, encourages team growth, and challenges the status quo. He encourages team spirit, leads by example, and works relentlessly toward company, team, and individual successes. John is successful for a reason - and one you want on your team!</span><br><strong class="bold-text-10">-Jesse Chase</strong></p>
